                    <p class="lg:w-1/2 w-full leading-relaxed text-gray-500">What makes a burger ‘Great’? Is it the texture of the bun or the tenderness and juiciness of the meat inside? Is it the perfection of the patty or the sauce that swirls around within? The reality is, even if you follow a recipe word
                        to word, the odds are that the burger won’t be as tasty as you wanted it to be. I’ve had so many bad burgers in my life, that I lost count. Starting from that minuscule 15 taka burger in the school canteen, which was basically
                        a little piece of beef potato chop tossed inside a bun; to that newly opened, over-hyped food court in the city where they served a fried chicken with bones and everything inside a soft bun; the truth is, my 90s childhood in Dhaka
                        wasn’t that scrumptious. However, it’s the past 15 years that gave rise to the vibrant and thriving food industry of Bangladesh, with Dhaka being the center. Living in 2015, and having tried most of the burgers all around the city,
                        it feels great to recommend some burgers which I believe are ‘must-eats’ if you are in Dhaka.</p>

                                this was the first proper burger I’ve had in Dhaka back in the late 2000s. The place is still up and running with multiple branches all over the city. Freshly grilled patty with gourmet cheese slices, there’s absolutely no reason not to have a smile on
                                your face when you leave this place after a meal. However, the place lacks consistency in taste between its many branches. I personally find the one in Satmasjid Road and the one in Gulshan 2 more authentic in flavor than
                                the other ones.

Eventually, kababs became a regular staple of Turkish cuisine. When Turkish rulers conquered new territory,
                        kababs travelled to the places with them. The food was introduced in the Indian subcontinent by the Mughals. We no longer know how exactly the soldiers originally grilled it or how the ancient conquerors liked their kababs. However,
                        tradition dictates fresh meat is a prerequisite for tasty kababs. The art of marinating and the correct amount of spices are two other pillars. Kababs have already proven its versatility by surviving for centuries, travelling around
                        the world, and taking on local avatars wherever it has travelled to. By the time it arrived in the Indian subcontinent, the soft and juicy Turkish kebabs took on a more burnt flavour.</p>
